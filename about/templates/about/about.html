      <p>To be, or not to be: that is the question: whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of
        outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; no
        more; and, by a sleep to say we end the heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to, 'tis a
        consummation devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; to sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub; for in
        that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil, must give us pause. There's
        the respect that makes calamity of so long a life; for who would bear the whips and scorns of time, the
        oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, the pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay, the insolence of
        office, and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes, when he himself might his quietus make with a
        bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear, to grunt and sweat under a weary life, but that the dread of something
        after death, the undiscover'd country from whose bourn no traveller returns, puzzles the will, and makes us
        rather bear those ills we have, than fly to others that we know not of? Thus consience doth make cowards of us
        all; and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, and enterprises of
        great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry, and lose the name of action.</p>
